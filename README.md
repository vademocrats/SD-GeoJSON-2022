# SD-GeoJSON-2022
 GeoJSON files and Google Maps example for the newly created Senate districts (2021 Redistricting)

## Description
This project contains individual zip-compressed .KML and converted GeoJSON files corresponding to the 40 Senate districts (SD) per the approved 2021 Virginia Redistricting map. These files allow a developer to easily integrate a dynamic map using the corresponding polygon drawing into a website or application.

## Included example
We've included an example of how to apply these files into a website using Google Maps. Combined with other code snippet plugins, this allows a developer to see a working example that can be integrated into any website. Note that the example transforms the GeoJSON into a JSON file by applying additional fieldsets to render the shape into the file. The example itself also includes further configuration parameters including center coordinates, zoom, and color settings.

In order to get the example to work, the developer will have to acquire a Google API key and enable the corresponding Google Map JS API. More details can be found here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key.

## Disclaimer
This work is provided as is and will not be regularly updated. The example, along with the related files, may become obsolete in the future as new API and JSON integrations arise.
